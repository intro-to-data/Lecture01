# What is data science? (1/2)

[From Wikipedia: Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

> Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine
> learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and
> analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and
> theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
> statistics, information science, and computer science.



# What is data science? (2/2)

[From Wikipedia: Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

> Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth
> paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now
> data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing
> because of the impact of information technology" and the data
> deluge.

# Course objectives

- Learn how to think about data.
  - The fourth paradigm of science.
  - The data life cycle.
- Think about the role of data in our society both today and tomorrow.
- Learn some basic R programming skills.



# Class structure

- Lecture will be uploaded to Canvas every week.
  - I am going to try to integrate the lecture/readings.
  - I've not done this before. I'm sure the quality of the editing will improve.
- We will have a midterm and a final exam.
- There is one 2-4 page paper due in the second half of the semester.
- There are a series of discussion, "Beyond The Numbers"
  - Goal: I want you to think about the role of data in our society.
  - These _are_ worth points.
- There are also three opportunities for feedback/check-in.
  - These are also worth points.



# R, Posit Cloud

- Projects will be completed using a programming language called R.
- If you are interested, I can help you get R installed on your
  computer.
- In class, we will use R in Posit Cloud.



# Questions/Concerns

- Learning how to program is not easy.
- Google, StackOverflow, etc. are your friend.
- Office Hours: Fridays from 1:00 - 2:00 PM.
  - 4:00 - 5:00 by appointment only



# Lab

- Based on feedback from prior years, trying a new lab structure.
  - Remote lecture (this thing I'm doing right now!)
  - Friday, in-person lab.
  - Some labs may be preceded by a class discussion.
  - Labs will build on the material introduced in the lecture/readings.
  - Please come prepared.
- We will start the lab together. I will stay as long as needed to
  answer questions. You may leave at any time although I recommend
  staying and working through the lab.



# My Videos

- This is my first try at remote lectures.
- Please feel free to give me feedback about how I'm doing this.
