# Who am I?

- Andy Choens, MSW
- I lead the data science team at a healthcare startup that was in
  Troy before the Pandemic. Now, I believe our address is Zoom.
- I have a background in computer programming, statistical analysis,
  healthcare, child welfare, and elder care.



# Who are you?

## Setup

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
## <- is the assignment operator in R!
survey <- read_csv("data/survey.csv")
```

## Survey Data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, page.printed=TRUE}
survey %>% mutate(pizza = str_trunc(pizza, 50)) %>% kable()
```
- Each row is a single survey entry.
- Each column contains the answer for a single question.
- Each data sell contains the answer for a single student to a single
  question.
- The grain of this data is student survey or just student since you
  can't have more than one row.

## Numeric

### What is your current age?

```{r}
ggplot(survey, aes(y = age)) + geom_boxplot()
```

The average age of a student is `r mean(survey$age, na.rm = TRUE)`
with a standard deviation of +/- `r sd(survey$age, na.rm = TRUE)` and
`r sum(is.na(survey$age))` students chose to not answer this question
(which is fine).

- Age is an example of a numeric data type.
- My "analysis" here treats it as a continuous variable, although it
  isn't.
    - I really shouldn't calculate the "average" age to 5 decimal
      places when I asked you to enter it as an integer . . . .
- The average is a measure of cetral tendency.
- The average, standard deviation, etc. are aggregate statistics and
  they are at a different grain.
    - Our raw data is at the student grain.
    - The aggregate data is at the class grain because it contains all
      the answers for all the students in the class.
- Something we will discuss more is the statistical error we often
  make by jumping to turn a continuous variable like age into a
  cetegorical variable such as an age cohort.

## Categorical

### What is your Degree/Program/Major?

```{r}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = degree)) + geom_bar()
```

- Unlike age, ther's no average here.
- The measure of centrality we use is mode which is simply the largest group.

### What year are you in at ACPHS?

```{r}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = year)) + geom_bar()
```

- I could have just put in numbers here, but I wanted to be sure we
  treated this as a categorical.

### Lecture/Lab (Separate or combined?)

```{r}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = separate)) + geom_bar()
```

- This is the first time I've ever asked that question.
- We are going to be remote for at least the first two weeks.
- For as long as we are remote, lectures will be recorded and posted to Zoom.
- We could separate the lecture from the lab.

### Do you like math?

```{r}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = like_math)) + geom_bar()
```

- Do you think these results are representative of ACPHS? 
- Do you think these results are representative of all young adults? 

### Are  you good at counting things?

```{r}
survey %>%
    group_by(counting) %>%
    summarise(n = n())
```

- Counting things is hard and this question was ridiculous.
- Yet the questions and categories themselves are often just as arbitrary, if less funny.
    - [Big Win for Better Data for All: NY Governor Kathy Hochul Signs AA and NH/PI Data Disaggregation Bill into Law!
](https://hcfany.org/big-win-for-better-data-for-all-ny-governor-kathy-hochul-signs-aa-and-nh-pi-data-disaggregation-bill-into-law/)
    - There's just no way to make long links look pretty in RMarkdown.

From the link:

> On December 23, 2021, Governor Kathy Hochul signed the NYS Bill
> S6639/A6896 on Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
> (AA and NH/PI) data disaggregation into law.
> 
> This law mandates that all State agencies, departments, boards, and
> commissions that already collect demographic data must now collect
> data on the top ten most populous AA ethnic groups and specific
> NH/PI ethnic groups of New York State along with data on languages
> spoken.  The law also specifies that such government entities must
> release such data to the public on an annual basis. This huge
> victory in the fight for better data for all was only made possible
> by over ten years of persistent advocacy by CACF and CACFâ€™s members
> and partners!

Federal Race Categories:

- [Census Quick Facts: Race](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/note/US/RHI625219)
- OMB requires that race data be collectd for a minimum of five groups:
    - White,
    - Black or African American,
    - American Indian or Alaska Native,
    - Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.
- OMB permits the Census Bureau to also use a sixth category - Some Other Race.
- Respondents may report more than one race.
- The concept of race is separate from the concept of Hispanic
  origin. Percentages for the various race categories add to 100
  percent, and should not be combined with the percent Hispanic.

I am using the census as my example here because many agencies and
private organizations in the US base their data collection loosely
around the US Census rules.

The concept of "race" is unique to humans. And while it is an
important part of an individual's identify, the categories themselves
are often arbitrary and capricious. And, many private systems such as
EHRs, do not allow a person to select more than one race.

- Some people select more than one race on the census but in other
  settings are forced to select only one.
- Analysis of people who select more than one race are also
  complicated because these numbers are usually reported out based on
  only a single race.

Questions:
- Reactions?
- How do you feel about Hispanic not being a race?
- How can we do better?

### Have you ever analyzed data?

```{r}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = data_ever)) + geom_bar()
```

OK, so let's pause for a moment. There's more we could do here.

```{r}
survey %>%
    group_by(like_math, data_ever) %>%
    summarise(n = n()) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = "data_ever", values_from = n)
```

- This puts the answers for `like_math` in the first column and the
  answers for `data_ever` across the top.
- This arrangement is arbitrary.
- But this is yet another grain. Now it is students per like math
  answers.
- This is called pivoting the data.
- And we can slice, dice, and pivot larger/more complex data sets to
  ask all sorts of interesting questions.

### How strong is your belief that humans cause climate change?

```{r}
survey %>%
    group_by(climate) %>%
    summarise(n = n()) %>%
    mutate(p = round(n/sum(n),1))
```

- This could have also been asked as a Likert scale.

### What state are you from?

```{r}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = state)) + geom_bar()
```

## Free Text

## What is your favorite kind of pizza?

```{r page.printed=TRUE}
survey %>% select(pizza) %>% kable()
```



# Course Description/Objectives

> Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific
> methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and
> insights from data in various forms, both structured and
> unstructured, similar to data mining.
> 
> Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine
> learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and
> analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It employs techniques and
> theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
> statistics, information science, and computer science.
> 
> Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth
> paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now
> data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing
> because of the impact of information technology" and the data
> deluge.

# R, RStudio Cloud

- Projects will be completed using a programming language called R.
- If you are interested, I can help you get R installed on your
  computer.
- In class, we will use R in RStudio Cloud.
- You should have received an invitation to join my RStudio Cloud
  instance.
- Since we are all remote, I hope this works better than asking you to
  log into the lab.
- Has everyone received their invitation and logged on?



# Questions/Concerns

- Programming is not an easy thing to wrap your head around.
- It _is_ frustrating at times.
- Google, StackOverflow, etc. are your friend.
- ???



# Lab(rador)

- On Thursday, after our lecture, you will start/complete a lab.
- Based on feedback from prior years, I am trying a new structure for
  the lab.
- We will start the lab together. I will stay as long as needed to
  answer questions. You may leave at any time although I recommend
  staying and working through the lab.
- Labs are due by midnight on the Monday following our lecture.

Now, let's open [lab.Rmd](./lab.Rmd) to see an example lab.
