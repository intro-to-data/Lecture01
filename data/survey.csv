We have completed our data extraction in REDCap and are beginning to think about next steps for analysis. ",3rd Year (Junior),"Yes, separate lecture",3,Yes,Are you kidding? That's a question?,Yes,"Excel (or LibreOffice Sheets\, Google Sheets\, etc.)","So far I've enjoyed the limited exposure that I've had to research, data, and statistics, so I'm hoping this course will help me decide whether I truly enjoy data science and should pursue it further.",Yes,"I'm a bit worried that I have no previous coding experience, however, I'm excited to start learning something completely brand new.",Massachusetts,NA

The cheese really makes it delicious no matter what. I don't have pizza often though.",Other,"I mean, don't we all? We all use data constantly, it isn't all numerical.
