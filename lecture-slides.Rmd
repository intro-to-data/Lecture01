# Who am I?

- Andy Choens, MSW
- I lead the data science team at a healthcare startup that was in
  Troy before the Pandemic. Now, I believe our address is Zoom.
- I have a background in computer programming, statistical analysis,
  healthcare, child welfare, and elder care.
  
OK - that's me. Who are you?

Tell me who you are and answer one or more of the following questions In the
last year of your life:

- Have you consumed any news or media which contained data?
- Have you tried to use data to make a decision?
- Have you been forced to assess the validity/reliability of any data?

# Course Description/Objectives

> Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific
> methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and
> insights from data in various forms, both structured and
> unstructured, similar to data mining.
> 
> Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine
> learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and
> analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It employs techniques and
> theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
> statistics, information science, and computer science.
> 
> Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth
> paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now
> data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing
> because of the impact of information technology" and the data
> deluge.

## Data Science In One Image

- Data Science is an interdisciplinary "fourth paradigm" of science.
- Class materials will be here on GitHub: [github.com/intro-to-data/Class](https://github.com/intro-to-data/Class)

## Objectives:

- Learn how to convert data into knowledge. Data is not knowledge. It
  is just data. Knowledge is what is developed from the process of
  understanding the data.
- Develop skills to help you solve complex problems by breaking these
  problems down in smaller, more manageable steps.



# Discuss R, RStudio Cloud

- Projects will be completed using a programming language called R.
- If you are interested, I can help you get R installed on your
  computer.
- In class, we will use R in RStudio Cloud.
- You should have received an invitation to join my RStudio Cloud
  instance.
- Since we are all remote, I hope this works better than asking you to
  log into the lab.
- Has everyone received their invitation and logged on?



# Your First Plot

Learning Objectives:

- What is a data frame?
    - Rows V columns?
    - What is a row of data?
    - Data types?
    - Why so many questions?
- YOU CAN DO THIS!!!!
- We are going to break this down into little bitty steps, and then
  use those little steps to do more complex things.

# Setup

To make sure you have everything loaded you will need for the lecture/lab, look for a section labeled "Setup".

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
## Don't stress the details tonight.
## We have all semester.
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

data(starwars)
starwars
```

Things we need to discuss:

- What is a data frame?
    - Rows V columns?
    - What is a row of data?
    - Data types?
    - Why so many questions?
    
Now, let's do a little more programming.

```{r}
ggplot(
    data = starwars,
    mapping = aes(x = homeworld)
    ) +
    geom_bar()
```

I can't read the X Axis can you?


```{r}
ggplot(
    data = starwars,
    mapping = aes(y = homeworld)
    ) +
    geom_bar()
```

Much better!

```{r}

# Can YOU draw a bar plot showing the number of characters by species?

```

```{r}
ggplot(
    data = starwars,
    mapping = aes(x = mass, y = height)
    ) +
    geom_point()
```

We've got ONE REALLY heavy character.


```{r}
ggplot(
    data = starwars,
    mapping = aes(x = mass, y = height, label = name)
    ) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_text_repel()
```

Damn Hutts.

OK, let's drop the anyone more than 1,000 pounds from our "analysis"

```{r}
lighter_starwars <-
    starwars %>%
    filter(mass < 1000)

ggplot(
    data = lighter_starwars,
    mapping = aes(x = mass, y = height, label = name)
    ) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_text_repel()
```

And now a basic regression line.

```{r}
ggplot(
    data = lighter_starwars,
    mapping = aes(x = mass, y = height, label = name)
    ) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +
    geom_text_repel()
```

Last challenge for tonight:

```{r}
## - Load the midwest data set.
## - What is the relationship between college education and poverty?
## - Hint: Look at the percollege and percbelowpoverty
data(midwest)
?midwest

## YOUR TURN!

```



# This week's lab

- There will be a lab due each week this semester, except for this
  "week" and the week of the final.
- You will be given access to the week's lab on Monday.
- The lab is due that Saturday at midnight, not that I suggest you
  spend Saturday night working on my lab (or any other lab, frankly).
- Completing the lab will require you to demonstrate skills discussed
  in class and in the reading/videos.
- If you have questions about the lab, feel free to contact me.
- We can also discuss your questions during class-time that week.

Now, let's open [lab.Rmd](./lab.Rmd) to see an example lab.



# Your Questions/Concerns

- Programming is not an easy thing to wrap your head around.
- It _is_ frustrating at times.
- Last year, the first year we used Canvas, I tried to use the
  message-board/chat feature. For some assignments it worked
  "OK". But, honestly, it did not achieve the results I wanted.
- So, feedback request. I would like to have a moderated discussion
  forum for this class. It would make it easier for me to support you.
- More importantly, it would make it easier for you to support each
  other.
- ???
